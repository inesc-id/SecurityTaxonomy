# ISMS

An Information Security Management System (**ISMS**) is a set of policies and procedures for systematically managing an organization's sensitive data.
The goal of an ISMS is to minimize risk and ensure business continuity by pro-actively limiting the impact of a security breach.

An ISMS typically addresses employee behavior and processes as well as data and technology.
It can be targeted towards a particular type of data, such as customer data, or it can be implemented in a comprehensive way that becomes part of the company's culture.
