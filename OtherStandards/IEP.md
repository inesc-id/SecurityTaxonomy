# IEP

The Information Exchange Policy (**IEP**) sets out that Computer Security Incident Response Teams ([CSIRT](../Definitions/CSIRT.md "CSIRT")), security communities, organizations and vendors may consider implementing the IEP framework to support their information sharing and information exchange initiatives.
This framework is intended to support both the existing approaches to defining information exchange used and information exchange policies that organizations will need as their information exchanges mature and evolve.
