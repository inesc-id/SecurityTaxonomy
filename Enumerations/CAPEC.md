# CAPEC

Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (**CAPEC**) is a publicly available catalog of attack patterns along with a comprehensive schema and classification taxonomy created to assist in the building of secure software.
By structuring the definition of attack patterns as part of a broader integrated software assurance knowledge architecture that includes similar knowledge-structuring efforts such as Common Weakness Enumeration ([CWE](../Enumerations/CWE.md "CWE")), Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures ([CVE](../Enumerations/CVE.md "CVE")), Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization ([MAEC](../ActionableObservables/MAEC.md "MAEC")), and Cyber Observable eXpression ([CybOX](../ActionableObservables/CybOX.md "CybOX")), CAPEC supports the needs of developers, testers, and educators to build secure software and assists in enhancing security throughout the software development lifecycle.
