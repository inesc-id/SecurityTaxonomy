# CPE

Common Platform Enumeration (**CPE**) standard provides a consistent and structured naming scheme for operating systems, software packages and classes of hardware devices.
It is based on the generic syntax for Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) and includes a method by which vendors can validate that their product names are accurately represented in the CPE system.
CPE identifies abstract classes of products, not specific instances, e.g. it does not include serial numbers.
