# NVD

Formerly known as Internet Categorization of Attacks Toolkit (ICAT), the National Vulnerability Database (**NVD**) is a repository of standards-based vulnerability management data that uses the Security Content Automation Protocol ([SCAP](../High-levelFrameworks/SCAP.md "SCAP")).
The NVD is a product of the Information Technology Laboratory (ITL), one of the [NIST](../Organizations/NIST.md "NIST") research laboratories.
Apart from providing and performing an analysis on a list of published [CVEs](./CVE.md "CVE"), the NVD also scores vulnerabilities using the [CVSS](../ScoringAndMeasurementFrameworks/CVSS.md "CVSS").
