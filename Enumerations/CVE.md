# CVE

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (**CVE**) is a dictionary of common names, i.e. CVE Identifiers, for publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
CVE's common identifiers make it easier to share data across separate network security databases and tools, and provide a baseline for evaluating the coverage of the security tools of the organization.
If a report from one of your security tools incorporates CVE Identifiers, you may then quickly and accurately access fix information in one or more separate CVE-compatible databases to remediate the problem.
