# Security Focus

Created in 1999, **SecurityFocus** is a news portal for all things computer security related.
It started just as a portal with original news content but later began to provide technical papers on the security subject.
It maintains the well-known [BugTraq](https://bugtraq.securityfocus.com "BugTraq homepage") mailing list that provides its subscribers with vulnerabilities announcements.
