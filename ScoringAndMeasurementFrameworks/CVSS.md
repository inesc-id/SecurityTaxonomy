# CVSS

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (**CVSS**) is a scoring system for describing and rating IT vulnerabilities.
CVSS is composed of three groups: base, temporal, and environmental, each of which includes a set of metrics.
The base score has the most significant influence on the final score.
Scores range from 0 to 10, where 10 corresponds to the most critical vulnerability.
