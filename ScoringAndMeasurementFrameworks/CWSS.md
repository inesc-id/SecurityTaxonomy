# CWSS

Common Weakness Scoring System (**CWSS**) is a mechanism for scoring weaknesses discovered in software so that fixes can be prioritized.
Conceptually, [CVSS](./CVSS.md "CVSS") and CWSS are very similar: where CVSS is used to score specific vulnerabilities, CWSS is used to score weaknesses that could potentially be exploited.
CWSS scores are associated with weaknesses identified on the [CWE](../Enumerations/CWE.md "CWE") list, and range from 0 to 100.
