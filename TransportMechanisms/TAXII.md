# TAXII

Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (**TAXII**) is a free and open transport mechanism that standardizes the automated exchange of cyber threat information.
In particular, TAXII was designed as the transport protocol for [STIX](../ReportingFormats/STIX.md "STIX").
Through the use of TAXII services, organizations can share cyber threat information in a secure and automated manner.

TAXII is not a specific information sharing initiative or application and does not attempt to define trust agreements, governance, or other non-technical aspects of cyber threat information sharing.
Instead, TAXII empowers organizations to achieve improved situational awareness about emerging threats, and enables organizations to easily share the information they choose with the partners they choose.
