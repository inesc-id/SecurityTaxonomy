# CVRF

The [ICASI](../Organizations/ICASI.md "ICASI") Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework (**CVRF**) is a XML-based data exchange format designed to support the automation of software vulnerability data reporting and consumption. A CVRF document describes the whole vulnerability handling lifecycle, from the discovery of the vulnerability to shipping a patched version of vulnerable software.

In November 16, 2016 ICASI transferred further development and maintenance to the OASIS CSAF Technical Committee.
