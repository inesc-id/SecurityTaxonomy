# IODEF-SCI

IODEF-SCI (**[IODEF](./IODEF.md "IODEF") for Structured Cybersecurity Information**) is a set of [IODEF](./IODEF.md "IODEF") extensions for embedding structured information within an [IODEF](./IODEF.md "IODEF") document. IODEF-SCI uses other formats for the representation of the embedded information, and defines new classes for types of information that are not defined in [IODEF](./IODEF.md "IODEF").
