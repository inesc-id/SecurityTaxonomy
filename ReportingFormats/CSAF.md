# CSAF

The Common Security Advisory Framework (**CSAF**) Technical Committee (TC) goal is to standardize the practices for structured machine-readable security vulnerability-related advisories.
The CSAF TC will base its efforts on the Common Vulnerability Reporting Framework ([CVRF](./CVRF.md "CVRF")) specification originally developed by the Industry Consortium for Advancement of Security on the Internet ([ICASI](../Organizations/ICASI.md "ICASI")).
