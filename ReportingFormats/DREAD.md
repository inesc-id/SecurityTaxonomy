# DREAD

Previously used by _Microsoft_, **DREAD** is a risk assessment tool for threats.
It provides a mnemonic for rating the risk of a threat using five different categories:

- **D**amage - how bad the attack is;
- **R**eproducibility - how easy is to reproduce the attack;
- **E**xploitability - how much work it takes to launch the attack;
- **A**ffected users - how many users will be impacted by the attack;
- **D**iscoverability - how easy is it to discover the threat.
