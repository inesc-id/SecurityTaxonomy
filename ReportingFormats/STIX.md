# STIX

Structured Threat Information Expression (**STIX**) is a structured language for the specifications, capture, characterization and comunications of standardized cyber threat information so it can be shared, stored, and analyzed in a consistent manner. The STIX Language conveys the full range of potential cyber threat information and strives to be fully expressive, flexible, extensible, automatable, and as human-readable as possible.

Its data model is built upon eight principal concepts: observables, indicators, incidents, [TTPs](../Definitions/TTPs.md "TTPs"), exploit targets, campaigns, threat actors and course of actions.
