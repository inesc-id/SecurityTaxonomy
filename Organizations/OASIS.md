# OASIS

**OASIS** is an industry consortium.
Its members broadly represent the marketplace of public and private sector technology leaders, users and influencers.
The consortium has more than 5,000 participants representing over 600 organizations and individual members in more than 65 countries.

OASIS is distinguished by its transparent governance and operating procedures.
Members themselves set the OASIS technical agenda, using a lightweight process expressly designed to promote industry consensus and unite disparate efforts.
Completed work is ratified by open ballot.
Governance is accountable and unrestricted.
Officers of both the OASIS Board of Directors and Technical Advisory Board are chosen by democratic election to serve two-year terms.
Consortium leadership is based on individual merit and is not tied to financial contribution, corporate standing, or special appointment.
