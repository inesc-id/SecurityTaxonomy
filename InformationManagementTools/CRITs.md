# CRITs

Collaborative Research Into Threats (**CRITs**) is an open source _malware_ and threat repository that leverages other open source software to create a unified tool for analysts and security experts engaged in threat defense.
It has been in development since 2010 with one goal in mind: give the security community a flexible and open platform for analyzing and collaborating on threat data.

Since CRITs is free and open source, it provides organizations around the world with the capability to quickly adapt to an ever-changing threat landscape.
CRITs can be installed locally for a private isolated instance or shared among other trusted organizations as a collaborative defense mechanism.
