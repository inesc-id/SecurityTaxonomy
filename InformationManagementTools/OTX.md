# OTX

Open Threat Exchange (**OTX**) is the world's largest crowd-sourced computer-security platform with more than 26,000 participants in 140 countries who share more than one million potential threats daily.
Founded in 2012, OTX was created and is run by AlienVault, a developer of commercial and open source solutions to manage cyber attacks.
The collaborative threat exchange is free and was created partly as a counterweight to criminal hackers successfully working together and sharing information about viruses, malware and other cyber attacks.
