# MISP

The Malware Information Sharing Platform (**MISP**) tool facilitates the exchange of Indicators of Compromise ([IOCs](../Definitions/IOC.md "IOC")) about targeted malware and attacks, within your community of trusted members.
MISP is a distributed [IOC](../Definitions/IOC.md "IOC") database containing technical and non-technical information.
Exchanging such information should result in faster detection of targeted attacks and improve the detection ratio, whilst also reducing the number of false positives.
