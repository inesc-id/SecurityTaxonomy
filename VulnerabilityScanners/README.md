# Vulnerability Scanners

A vulnerability scanner is a computer program designed to assess computer systems, networks or applications for known weaknesses.
Vulnerability scanning can help identify outdated software versions, missing patches, and misconfigurations, and validate compliance with or deviations from an organization's security policy.
This is done by identifying the operating systems and major software applications running on the hosts and matching them with information on known vulnerabilities stored in the scanners' vulnerability databases.
