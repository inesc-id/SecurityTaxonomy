# Nessus

**Nessus** is a vulnerability scanning tool.
Initially, Nessus consisted of two main components: _nessusd_, the Nessus daemon, which does the scanning, and _nessus_, the client, which controls scans and presents the vulnerability results to the user.
Later versions of Nessus (4 and greater) utilize a web server which provides the same functionality as the client.

In typical operation, Nessus begins by doing a port scan with one of its four internal port scanners (or it can optionally use [AMAP](https://www.thc.org/ "AMAP homepage") or [Nmap](https://nmap.org/ "Nmap homepage")) to determine which ports are open on the target and then tries various exploits on the open ports.
The vulnerability tests, available as subscriptions, are written in **NASL** (Nessus Attack Scripting Language), a scripting language optimized for custom network interaction.
