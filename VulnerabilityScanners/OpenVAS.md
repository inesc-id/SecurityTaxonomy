# OpenVAS

Open Vulnerability Assessment System (**OpenVAS**) is an open source software framework of several services and tools offering vulnerability scanning and vulnerability management.
OpenVAS began under the name of _GNessUs_, as a fork of the previously open source [Nessus](./Nessus.md "Nessus") scanning tool, after its developers Tenable Network Security changed it to a proprietary license in October 2005.
