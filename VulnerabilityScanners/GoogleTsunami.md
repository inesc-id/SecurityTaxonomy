# Google Tsunami

Google Tsunami is a general purpose network security scanner that aims at detecting high severity vulnerabilities with high confidence that offers an extensible engine through the use of plugins.
It uses a two-step process: reconnaissance and vulnerability verification.
In the first step it uses Nmap as a port scanner to detect any open ports.
In the second step, it uses some fingerprinting techniques to try to identify the services running on each of the previously scanned open ports.
