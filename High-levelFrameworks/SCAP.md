# SCAP

**SCAP** is a process framework for the automation of security procedures related to vulnerability management, measurement, and remediation.
The SCAP standard is the result of a community-driven synthesis of a number of open security standards and protocols.
The framework defines methods for enumerating and assessing software weaknesses and vulnerabilities, and for the automation of policy compliance evaluation.
