These formats are used to represent certain characteristics of threats, e.g. system libraries used by a _malware_ sample, that have been explicitly identified by the producer of the information.
This kind of information is often referred to as "indicators", "detection indicators" or, more narrowly, "[indicators of compromise](../Definitions/IOC.md "IOC")" since it can be used to detect attacks and other malicious activity, e.g. _botnet_ communication.
