# MAEC

Malware Attribute Enumeration and Characterization (**MAEC**) (pronounced "mike") is a community-developed structured language for encoding and communicating high-fidelity information about _malware_ based upon attributes such as behaviors, artifacts, and attack patterns.

The MAEC schema defines a standard set of _malware_ attributes that includes simple attributes like name, size, cryptographic hashes and AV classifications.
It also includes ways of describing low-level executable behavior, including descriptions of processes spawned, system calls made, files created, registry keys modified, and network communications.
Finally, it can be used to describe malicious behaviors found or observed in _malware_ at a higher level, indicating the vulnerabilities it exploits, behavior like email address harvesting from contact lists or disabling of a security service.
